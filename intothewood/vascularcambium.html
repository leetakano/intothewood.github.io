        <h2>Vascular Cambium</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        
        <p>According to Simpson's Plant Systematics, the vascular cambium 
          is a cylindrical sheath of cells that undergoes primarily 
          tangential divisions, producing secondary xylem (wood) to the 
          inside and secondary phloem (inner bark) to the outside.</p>

        <p>There are two main categories of cells within the vascular 
          cambium: fusiform initials and ray initials.</p>
        <hr>
    
        
        <h3>Fusiform Initials</h3>
        <p>Also known as rocket initials for their shape. These cells will never 
          be sclerified, so they will always have a soft primary wall. Since fusiform 
          initials are meristematic cells, they can produce secondary vascular tissue, 
          parenchyma, fibers, and more.</p>
        <p>There are two types of fusiform initials</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Storied cambium</li>
          <li>Non-storied cambium</li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
      
        
        <h3>Ray Initials</h3>
        <p>Radially-oriented meristematic cells are produced by fusiform 
          initials. Like fusiform initials, ray initials produce parenchyma,
           but they do not produce secondary vascular tissues. In addition to 
           storing water and nutrients, ray initials transport them.</p>
        <p>There are two types of ray initials</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Uniseriate</li>
          <li>Multiseriate</li>
        </ol>
