        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <!--Needs revision-->
        <p>Gymnosperms are seed plants that do not flower. In order 
            for plants to flower, they require ovaries to cover the seed.
            Hence, their name's meaning, "naked seed," in Greek.</p>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
            <p>Ginkgo</p>
            <p>Pines</p>
        <hr>
        
        <h3>Gymnosperm Wood</h3>
        <p>Also known as "softwood," gymnosperms are known to have more 
            homogenous or simple tissues compared to their flowering 
            cousins. As such, they don't have vessel elements, sieve tubes, 
            and companion cells (Clark, 2021).</p>
        <p>However, gymnosperms have structures called resin canals that are 
        often mistaken as xylem by beginners. Perhaps they aren't so simple 
        after all...</p>
        <hr>
        
        <h3>Compression Wood</h3>
        <p>It was a dark and stormy night.<br> 
            The gymnosperm tree must stay upright. <br>
            Against the strong wind’s might.<br>
            To stay upright, it used a strategy.<br>
            “Compression wood!” cried the tree.<br>
            “This will save me!”<br>
            And the gymnosperm tree<br>
            Put up a mighty fight<br>
            Against the strong wind’s might.<br>
            And lasted throughout,<br>
            The dark and stormy night.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Ignoring the corny poem, compression wood is known for having 
            dense rings where the tree bends. Why is this important? See 
            tension wood under the angiosperm page.</p>

        <h3>Fun facts About Compression Wood</h3>
