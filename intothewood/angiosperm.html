        <h2>Angiosperms</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <!--Needs revision-->
        <p>Angiosperms are seed plants that do flower. Hence the name, 
            "flowering seed" with "angio" meaning flower and "sperm" meaning 
            "seed" in Greek. There are two types of flowering plants: 
            monocotyledons and dicotyledons. Or monocots and dicots for 
            short (Simpson, 2006).</p>

        <h3>Angiosperm Wood</h3>
        <p>Also known as "hardwood," angiosperms are known to have more 
            heterogeneous or simple tissues compared to their naked cousins. 
            As such, they can have incredibly diverse structures.</p>

        <p>Some angiosperms have tracheids in addition to vessel elements. 
            Even trees have a hard time letting go of their roots... 
            Excuse the pun.</p>

        <h3>Tension Wood</h3>
        <p>It was a dark and stormy night. <br>
            And the angiosperm tree must stay upright. <br>
            To stay upright, it used a strategy.<br>
            Tension wood, it's called<br>
            But the gymnosperm tree<br>
            Is appalled<br>

            "What are you doing?" It cried.<br>

            "Well," said the angiosperm tree,<br>
            "I'm trying to stay upright.<br>
            Using tension wood to get through the night."<br>
            
            "But wood shouldn't be gelatinous!"<br>

            "Well, I am in this crisis."<br>

            And stayed upright it did<br>
            The angiosperm tree.<br>
        </p>

        <!--Needs revision-->
        <p>Ignoring the corny poem,  tension wood does have gelatinous 
            fibers to keep the tree upright. These fibers pull the tree up
            rather than harden the tree. Because of this, angiosperms have
            dense rings opposite to where the tree bends. Take a nice look
            at the tree diagrams. They should be helpful.</p>

        <h3>Fun facts About Tension Wood</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Its gelatinous fibers are a result of intrusive growth</li>
                <li>The gelatinous layer is located in the secondary cell wall</li>            </ul>
