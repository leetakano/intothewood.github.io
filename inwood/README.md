<h1>About inWOOD</h1>
<h2>Main target audience: </h2>
<p>Botany students at Iowa State University. </p>

<h2>Side target audience:</h2>
<p>Side target audience: Other botany students at other universities. </p>

<h2>Purpose: </h2>
<p>Learn, review, and test their knowledge. When I took BIOL 454, Plant Anatomy in Fall 2021, there wasn't a lot of free study materials on the internet where 
   I can do all three things. The resources I did find, they weren't completely consistent with the materials I was given. So, this was my solution. </p>
<p>Tl;dr, I want wood anatomy (and to an extent, plant anatomy) to become more accessible to university students and hopefully, to the general public.</p>

<h2>Features already implemented: </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Interactive and diverse quizzes where each answer is randomized.</li>
  <li>Original drawings and illustrations done by me.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features to be implemented: </h2>
<h3>Glossary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Contains most important <strong>plant anatomy</strong> terminology.</li>
  <li>All terminology in the website is formatted into a flashcard. Each flashcard has a drawing (done by me) and a photo (taken by me or Dr. Klahs).</li>
  <li>Glossary has interactive quiz on wood anatomy and overall plant anatomy vocabulary. Students can choose which quiz they want to take.</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h2>What you can do to contribute:</h2>
 <p>This entire website has been done entirely from scratch. While it may not have been the best decision, I do not regret it because it led me to understand coding
    far more than any class or online tutorial I've taken. At the time, I haven't even thought I would aspire to become a web developer anyway.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Find bugs, fix them, and document/explain.</li>
  <li>Course material improvment. If there's anything contradictory or can be worded better, just let me know.</li>
  <li>Design suggestions.</li>
 </ul>
