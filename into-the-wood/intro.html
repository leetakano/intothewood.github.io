        <h2>Wood Anatomy</h2>
            <h3>What is wood?</h3>
                <p>Wood is essentially <strong>secondary xylem, </strong> 
                a type of tissue that arose from <strong> secondary growth. </strong>
                The secondary xylem is created by an outer ring of cells 
                <strong>(vascular cambium) </strong> and its main function
                 is to conduct water and minerals (Simpson, 2006).</p>

            <h3>Why learn wood anatomy?</h3>
                <p>Wood anatomy allows scientists to classify plant species.</p>
                <p>Classifying plant species is crucial information for various industries.</p>
                <h4>Carpentry</h4>
                    <p>Different types of wood require different methods of handling. 
                    Carpenters need to know how each wood acts for quality assurance.</p>
                <h4>Forestry</h4>
                    <p>All plants interact with their environment differently. Knowing 
                    these differences allows for better forest maintenance.</p>
